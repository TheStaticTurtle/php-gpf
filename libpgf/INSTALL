 Remark: The make process uses autoconf / automake / libtool.
 
 To compile and install the library, do the following:
 0.1	create folder 'm4' if not already available
 0.2	dos2unix *.* helps, if configure stops with "cannot fine input file Makefile.in"
 0.3	'autoreconf -i'		: instead of calling libtoolize, aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, automake
 1.1	'./configure' 
 1.2	'./configure --help'	: gives you more information
 2.	'make' 			: compiles a shared and a static library 
 3. 	'sudo make install' 	: installs the library 
 4.	'sudo ldconfig' 	: makes the new library visible in the system 
 
 Note:	As this build process uses libtool there is a library interface created by 
 	libtool. This interface is libpgf.la, the static library itself is in libpgf.a
 	and the shared library iteslf is in libpgf.so.x.y. All these files are needed.
 	For more information see: http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool
